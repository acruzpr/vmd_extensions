This is a collection of TCL-VMD functions that support extraction of
structural data from large-scale simulations. These functions are
currently meant for TCL-VMD programmers.  Features easy semantics to

 * Iterate a block of code over frames
 * Iterate a block of code over trajectory files
 * Compute the number and fraction of native contacts
 * Compute distance matrices
 * ...and more
